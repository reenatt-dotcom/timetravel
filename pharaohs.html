      <h2>Pharaohs of Ancient Egypt</h2>
      <p>Ancient Egypt was ruled by powerful pharaohs who held both political and religious authority. These pharaohs were considered divine beings and were believed to be the intermediaries between the gods and the people.</p>
      <p>They led Egypt with absolute power, overseeing construction projects, religious ceremonies, and the defense of the kingdom. The pharaohs' tombs, such as the pyramids, were grand structures built to ensure their journey to the afterlife.</p>
