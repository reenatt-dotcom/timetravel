        <h3>About the Pyramids</h3>
        <p>The pyramids of Ancient Egypt are monumental structures built as tombs for pharaohs. They were constructed during the Old Kingdom period and served as the final resting places of the Egyptian kings and queens. The pyramids were built with great precision and engineering skill, using large blocks of limestone or granite. The most famous pyramid is the Great Pyramid of Giza, built for Pharaoh Khufu. It is the largest pyramid in Egypt and one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.</p>
