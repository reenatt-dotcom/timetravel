      <h2>Exploring Medieval Castle Architecture</h2>
      <p>Medieval castles were not only imposing structures but also architectural marvels. They were designed to provide defense, security, and a sense of power to their inhabitants. Explore the key architectural elements that defined the grandeur and functionality of medieval castles.</p>
      
      <h3>1. Keep or Donjon</h3>
      <p>The keep, or donjon, was the central and most fortified structure of the castle. It served as the residence of the lord or lady, as well as the last line of defense in times of attack.</p>

      <h3>2. Curtain Walls</h3>
      <p>Curtain walls surrounded the castle, providing a defensive barrier. They were made of stone and fortified with towers, allowing defenders to guard the castle from above.</p>

      <h3>3. Towers</h3>
      <p>Towers were strategically placed along the curtain walls to provide additional defensive positions and vantage points. They varied in shape and size, including round, square, and corner towers.</p>

      <h3>4. Drawbridge</h3>
      <p>The drawbridge was a movable bridge that connected the castle to the outside world. It could be raised or lowered to control access and defend against intruders.</p>

      <h3>5. Moat</h3>
      <p>A moat was a water-filled ditch surrounding the castle. It served as an additional obstacle for attackers, making it difficult to approach the castle walls.</p>

      <h3>6. Great Hall</h3>
      <p>The great hall was the central gathering place within the castle. It was used for feasting, celebrations, and important meetings. The lord or lady of the castle would sit at the head of the table.</p>
